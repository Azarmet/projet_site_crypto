Trump launched the digital token with branding including an image from his attempted assassination in July, expanding his cryptocurrency interests that already include World Liberty Financial.Melania Trump launched her own coin, $MELANIA, on Sunday that rallied in price to take its market cap well beyond $1 billion.Four-fifths of Trump coin’s tokens are owned by CIC Digital, an affiliate of Trump’s business, and another entity called Fight, Fight, Fight, according to its website. It says the coins are “an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‘$TRUMP’” and are not an investment or security. The launch of the coins caused surprise and concern even among those in the cryptocurrency industry. “While it’s tempting to dismiss this as just another Trump spectacle, the launch of the official Trump token opens up a Pandora’s box of ethical and regulatory questions,” said Justin D’Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong. The Trump Organization said this month the president would hand daily management of his multi-billion-dollar real estate, hotel, golf, media and licensing portfolio to his children when he entered the White House. By 1230 EST (1730 GMT), Trump’s coin was trading at $45.21, giving it a market cap of just over $9 billion, according to CoinMarketCap, which ranked it as the 19th biggest cryptocurrency. Twenty-four-hour trading volume was nearly $40 billion, CoinMarketCap data showed.
