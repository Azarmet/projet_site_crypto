Trump launched the digital token with branding including an image from his attempted assassination in July, expanding his cryptocurrency interests that already include World Liberty Financial.Melania Trump launched her own coin, $MELANIA, on Sunday that rallied in price to take its market cap well beyond $1 billion.Four-fifths of Trump coin’s tokens are owned by CIC Digital, an affiliate of Trump’s business, and another entity called Fight, Fight, Fight, according to its website. It says the coins are “an expression of support for, and engagement with, the ideals and beliefs embodied by the symbol ‘$TRUMP’” and are not an investment or security. The launch of the coins caused surprise and concern even among those in the cryptocurrency industry. “While it’s tempting to dismiss this as just another Trump spectacle, the launch of the official Trump token opens up a Pandora’s box of ethical and regulatory questions,” said Justin D’Anethan, an independent crypto analyst based in Hong Kong. The Trump Organization said this month the president would hand daily management of his multi-billion-dollar real estate, hotel, golf, media and licensing portfolio to his children when he entered the White House.

This move boosted investor confidence in the Trump administration's approach to crypto, despite not being addressed during the inauguration. With Commissioner Hester Peirce who’s known for her pro-crypto stance leading the task force, we can expect some progressive framework to take shape going forward. The broader market also saw strong buying, with tokens like Solana, Doge, and Chainlink rising up to 8% in a day.”CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “Bitcoin is currently trading within a consolidation range of $100K to $107K, holding steady at $106K. Michael Saylor has expanded his Bitcoin holdings, adding 11,000 BTC for $1.1 billion. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative, dubbed ‘Stargate,’ with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle leading the charge, and Microsoft and Nvidia as key tech partners. The announcement sparked a modest rally in AI-focused agent coins, reflecting growing investor interest in the sector.”Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder & CEO, Pi42, said, “Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, climbing back to a level of $106,000 before settling above $105,000 as optimism grows in the market. The positive reaction is caused by the weakening of the dollar index and the pro-business economic agenda of Trump. Other factors like the SEC announcing a new crypto task force and Bank of America CEO's statement about the world making crypto payments if clarity in regulations are provided.” Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin is currently trading lower by more than 2% at $103,558, after peaking at $109,350 earlier. The price movement seems to reflect a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern, as traders reacted to expectations surrounding Trump’s inauguration and potential crypto-friendly policies. Speculation around Trump’s possible executive order on crypto and the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve had fueled optimism. However, the launch of Trump and Melania meme coins diverted some market capital, limiting Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Despite the broader crypto market dropping 3.6%, Bitcoin remains resilient, reflecting ongoing interest in regulatory shifts.”Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, “In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has surged above $106,000, reflecting a significant market shift following the U.S. SEC's favorable stance on cryptocurrency regulations. This pivotal development marks the first major policy win for the crypto sector, igniting investor confidence and driving above a 3% increase in Bitcoin price. The future outlooks remain optimistic, with investors anticipating potential price targets exceeding a new high in the coming months due to strong demand and regulatory support.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder, CoinDCX, said, “After a small squeeze, the bulls have again backed the Bitcoin price rally, which surged above $107K before closing the previous day’s trade. As a result, the crypto markets began the day’s trade on a bullish note. With the start of the new administration in the U.S., the market dynamics for the cryptos have changed. While the American banks are also ready to embrace cryptos, the SEC launched a new crypto task force to develop a clear regulatory framework for them.”Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabpliveDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

This move boosted investor confidence in the Trump administration's approach to crypto, despite not being addressed during the inauguration. With Commissioner Hester Peirce who’s known for her pro-crypto stance leading the task force, we can expect some progressive framework to take shape going forward. The broader market also saw strong buying, with tokens like Solana, Doge, and Chainlink rising up to 8% in a day.”CoinSwitch Markets Desk noted, “Bitcoin is currently trading within a consolidation range of $100K to $107K, holding steady at $106K. Michael Saylor has expanded his Bitcoin holdings, adding 11,000 BTC for $1.1 billion. Meanwhile, former President Donald Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure initiative, dubbed ‘Stargate,’ with OpenAI, SoftBank, and Oracle leading the charge, and Microsoft and Nvidia as key tech partners. The announcement sparked a modest rally in AI-focused agent coins, reflecting growing investor interest in the sector.”Avinash Shekhar, Co-founder & CEO, Pi42, said, “Bitcoin has demonstrated remarkable resilience, climbing back to a level of $106,000 before settling above $105,000 as optimism grows in the market. The positive reaction is caused by the weakening of the dollar index and the pro-business economic agenda of Trump. Other factors like the SEC announcing a new crypto task force and Bank of America CEO's statement about the world making crypto payments if clarity in regulations are provided.” Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of Unocoin, said, “Bitcoin is currently trading lower by more than 2% at $103,558, after peaking at $109,350 earlier. The price movement seems to reflect a \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" pattern, as traders reacted to expectations surrounding Trump’s inauguration and potential crypto-friendly policies. Speculation around Trump’s possible executive order on crypto and the creation of a national Bitcoin reserve had fueled optimism. However, the launch of Trump and Melania meme coins diverted some market capital, limiting Bitcoin’s upward momentum. Despite the broader crypto market dropping 3.6%, Bitcoin remains resilient, reflecting ongoing interest in regulatory shifts.”Shivam Thakral, CEO of BuyUcoin, said, “In the last 24 hours, Bitcoin has surged above $106,000, reflecting a significant market shift following the U.S. SEC's favorable stance on cryptocurrency regulations. This pivotal development marks the first major policy win for the crypto sector, igniting investor confidence and driving above a 3% increase in Bitcoin price. The future outlooks remain optimistic, with investors anticipating potential price targets exceeding a new high in the coming months due to strong demand and regulatory support.” Sumit Gupta, co-founder, CoinDCX, said, “After a small squeeze, the bulls have again backed the Bitcoin price rally, which surged above $107K before closing the previous day’s trade. As a result, the crypto markets began the day’s trade on a bullish note. With the start of the new administration in the U.S., the market dynamics for the cryptos have changed. While the American banks are also ready to embrace cryptos, the SEC launched a new crypto task force to develop a clear regulatory framework for them.”Subscribe And Follow ABP Live On Telegram: t.me/officialabpliveDisclaimer: Crypto products and NFTs are unregulated and can be highly risky.

Trump’s been clear about his ‘America First’ agenda throughout his election campaign trail, emphasising the role of tariffs and deregulation in his approach to global trade, but how will UK/US trade be affected? British entrepreneur and investor, James Disney-May, predicts the impact of Trump’s potential policies on UK/US trade. Disney-May advises that the president-elect’s ‘America First’ approach could sway the UK-US trade in favour of American interests. He advises that UK investors should prepare to adjust their approach around potential new tariffs and sector-specific trade frictions. Trump’s proclivity for foreign businesses with a US presence could offer smoother regulatory pathways and preferential trade terms for UK businesses that are willing to establish local operations within the US, according to Disney-May. “The UK’s financial services sector, which is vital to its economy, may find short-term opportunities in the US market, however increased volatility poses long-term risks. “UK financial institutions may need to adjust their strategies to align with the evolving US regulatory landscape, particularly in ...","image_url":"https://www.newsanyway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/oleg-ivanov-VIMukLV1gtM-unsplash-scaled.jpg","published_at":"2025-01-22T18:04:25.412Z","url":"https://www.newsanyway.com/2025/01/22/trumps-america-first-approach-could-swing-uk-us-trade-in-favour-of-american-interests-says-uk-investor-and-entrepreneur/","source":"Inconnu"},{"title":"Best Meme Coins to Join for Long Term: Arctic Pablo Coin Hits $200k Mark as Turbo and Memecoin Brave Bearish Market Trends","description":"The meme coin market has been buzzing lately, and not just because of its quirky nature.

Trump’s been clear about his ‘America First’ agenda throughout his election campaign trail, emphasising the role of tariffs and deregulation in his approach to global trade, but how will UK/US trade be affected? British entrepreneur and investor, James Disney-May, predicts the impact of Trump’s potential policies on UK/US trade. Disney-May advises that the president-elect’s ‘America First’ approach could sway the UK-US trade in favour of American interests. He advises that UK investors should prepare to adjust their approach around potential new tariffs and sector-specific trade frictions. Trump’s proclivity for foreign businesses with a US presence could offer smoother regulatory pathways and preferential trade terms for UK businesses that are willing to establish local operations within the US, according to Disney-May. “The UK’s financial services sector, which is vital to its economy, may find short-term opportunities in the US market, however increased volatility poses long-term risks. “UK financial institutions may need to adjust their strategies to align with the evolving US regulatory landscape, particularly in ...","image_url":"https://www.newsanyway.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/oleg-ivanov-VIMukLV1gtM-unsplash-scaled.jpg","published_at":"2025-01-22T18:06:52.638Z","url":"https://www.newsanyway.com/2025/01/22/trumps-america-first-approach-could-swing-uk-us-trade-in-favour-of-american-interests-says-uk-investor-and-entrepreneur/","source":"Inconnu"},{"title":"Best Meme Coins to Join for Long Term: Arctic Pablo Coin Hits $200k Mark as Turbo and Memecoin Brave Bearish Market Trends","description":"The meme coin market has been buzzing lately, and not just because of its quirky nature.
